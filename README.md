# Blog Posts App

A simple React application that fetches and displays blog posts from the JSONPlaceholder API.

## Features

- Fetches blog posts from the JSONPlaceholder API
- Displays a list of blog posts with titles and bodies
- Handles errors and displays an error message if the API request fails

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/blog-posts-app.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm start`
4. Open the app in your browser: `http://localhost:3000`

## Code Structure

- `index.js`: The main entry point of the application
- `BlogPosts.js`: The React component that fetches and displays the blog posts
- `index.css`: The CSS styles for the application
- `fetchPostsFromAPI.js`: A separate function that handles the API request and error handling

## Error Handling

The application uses a try-catch block to catch any errors that occur during the API request. If an error occurs, the application sets the `error` state to the error message and displays an error message to the user.
